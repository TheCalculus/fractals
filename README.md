# Fractals Generator
Generates the Mandelbrot Set Fractal based on in-script parameters. Non-GUI based, requires a Python installation and prior knowledge to generate!
More hard-coded fractals to come (and maybe a custom fractal builder based on equations, if I can figure out how to do that!).
A lot of research went into figuring out the PIL library so apologies if there are mistakes in the code, I found it from online tutorials from sources such as codingame.com!
<hr>
 Example images (colour values calculated using a constant value on line 32), all of the Mandelbrot set with a max-iteration, or what I like to call "virtual infinity" of 80 (increasing this value alongside the resolution will increase the detail, but mess with those values at your own risk)

 Mandelbrot Blue (HSV, Constant of 150-200), Mandelbrot Red (HSV, No Additive constant)<br>

<h3>Next up, the Julia Set!</h3>

<p>Planned to be implemented within the next week or so (date of writing this: 14/03/22)</p>
<img src="https://github.com/TheCalculus/fractals/blob/main/number_theorems.png?raw=true" width=500> Julia Set (Position) (Deep Zoom), 19/03/22. Although the Julia set doesn't look as it is "supposed" to, but it matches the expected output. 
<h3>Next up, other Fractals! (nextup2, nu2)</h3>
