# mandelbrot coordinates apply to these coordinates as well, keeping in mind that the imaginary offset is the inverse (negative) of the real offset (meaning if you would like to position the point of focus at the Julia Set (0.79, 0.15i), you would have to input (0.79, -0.15i) as the real and imaginary offset) without the i

# the higher this number, the more accurate the fractal will be, but the longer it will take to render. be careful modifying this number, as it is the number of iterations the algorithm will run before deciding that the point is not in the Mandelbrot Set, therefore requiring more iterations and processing speed, hence potentially causing crashes or slowdowns. do not try to modify this number while you are using your computer unless it is exceptionally beefy. I was able to set this number to 10000 without crashes or much of an impact on other processes (video-streaming and gaming not tested) and rendered a fractal in 174.953s (Intel i7 8550u, 16GB RAM, integrated graphics)

# interpolation uses up additional processing power, keep that in mind. results with the current colouring algorithm aren't too aesthetically pleasing either, when at high resolutions, magnifications and iterations
